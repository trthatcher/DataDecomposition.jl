**DataDecomposition.jl** is a Julia package that implements various solvers for
several machine learning and statistical data decomposition/dimensionality
reduction methods. The packages implements solvers for the following methods:

- Kernel Principal Components Analysis

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

- Kernel Linear Discriminant Analysis
- Kernel Independent Component Analysis
- Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis
- Multiple Correspondence Analysis
